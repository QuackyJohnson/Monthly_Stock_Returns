# Monthly_Stock_Returns
A project to extract the returns of 4 stocks, namely Infosys, SBI, L&T & ITC over 4 years using yahoo-fin module and using their closing prices to calculate the returns given by the stocks, and plotting them using matplotlib.
I have taken only 4 stocks in order to simplify the project and have plotted their returns on a bar chart.
File descriptions-
hst- storing the historical data as well as the calculations
data - for importing the data from hst file and printing it out
plot - for plotting the returns
