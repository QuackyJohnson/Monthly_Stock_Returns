# Monthly_Stock_Returns
A project to extract the returns of 4 stocks, namely Infosys, SBI, L&T & ITC over 4 years using yahoo-fin module and using their closing prices to calculate the returns given by the stocks, and plotting them using matplotlib.
I have taken only 4 stocks in order to simplify the project.  
I would be grateful to my fellow Pythonistas if you could provide me with a feedback on my workings, so that I could improve upon the task and come up with something more better.
